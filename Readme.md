# Secure Wallet Login System with 2-Factor Authentication

## Project Description

The Secure Wallet Login System is an innovative blockchain-based smart contract built on the Aptos network that enhances traditional wallet security through the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA). This system addresses the growing need for robust security measures in cryptocurrency wallets by requiring users to verify their identity through both their private keys and a time-sensitive OTP (One-Time Password) sent to their registered phone number.

The smart contract creates a secure layer between users and their digital assets, ensuring that even if a private key is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented through the secondary authentication factor. This dual-verification approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized transactions and account breaches.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize wallet security in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by making 2-factor authentication a standard practice. We aim to bridge the gap between user convenience and security, ensuring that cryptocurrency adoption can continue safely without compromising on accessibility. 

We envision a future where every blockchain wallet incorporates multi-layered security protocols, making digital asset management as secure as traditional banking while maintaining the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. Our ultimate goal is to eliminate the fear of wallet compromises and provide users with confidence in their digital asset security.
